# Description
NETKill is a tool (obviously written in C) to be used in tests which will test a network's integrity to defend against a DoS/DDoS attack. (Disclaimers below)

# TODO: (ordered: most important - least important)
- Add ability to use hostnames instead of specific IP addresses.
- Correctly catch CTRL-C signals then free memory.
- Multithreading (Haven't figured it out yet.)


# DISCLAMER:
- Only to be used for the following purposes:
    - Research
    - Permitted testing
    - Other EDUCATIONAL purposes
- Do not use unless YOU HAVE PERMISSION by the target to test it.
- I am NOT responsible for any misuse or illicit acts committed using NETKill.
- Use at your discretion. I am not responsible for any damages cause by this tool.
- Some networks may not suffer immediately, however sustained attacks may have an impact.
