# Description
NetKill is a tool (obviously written in C) to be used in tests which support TCP and UDP streams and flood the target with random bytes.

# TODO: (ordered: most important - least important)
- Redo the socket part of the API such that we don't have to reuse code.
- Correctly catch CTRL-C signals then free memory.

    - Research
    - Permitted testing
